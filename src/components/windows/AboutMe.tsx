          <br />
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring retro computing, 
          playing classic video games, or contributing to open source projects. 
          I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating delightful 
          user experiences.

          <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> This entire portfolio was built using modern 
          React and TypeScript, but styled to perfectly recreate the Windows 95 
          experience. It's a testament to both my technical skills and attention 
          to detail! ðŸ’¾
